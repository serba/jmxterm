Download and Run

  * <<Download and install JDK>> - Before we start rolling, make sure JRE or JDK 1.5+ is installed on your computer and <<<java>>> command is runnable. Check out {{{http://www.java.com/en/download/}java.com/download}} if you haven't installed JDK. 

  * <<Download executable jmxterm package>> - jmxterm is designed to be ready for run out-of-box. The executable jar file is downloadable from {{{https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=91358&package_id=284164}SourceForge.net/cyclops-group download page}}. File <<<*-uber.jar>>> is the one ready to run out-of-box. Alternatively, you can {{{source-repository.html}Checkout Source Code}} and {{{sourcecode.html}Build From Source Code}}. The later version it is, the less buggy it is. Many bugs are found and many fixes are applied every day since this project just started. If you are not satisfied with the release version, try building the latest.

  * <<Run jmxterm with java -jar>> - Once you download <<<jmxterm-#-uber.jar>>> to local (for example /home/my/jmxterm-1.0-uber.jar), terminal can be opened with command <<<java -jar /home/my/jmxterm-1.0-uber.jar>>>. jmxterm executable package can also take several options for more flexible usage, please jump to {{{manual.html}Manual}} for more information.
